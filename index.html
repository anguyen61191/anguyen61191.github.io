Why Data Science?
    I've been asked this question a few times in the past couple of weeks and I've been asking myself
the same question.  Before we answer that question of why, we should ask ourselves what is data science?
Well the Wikipedia article states that "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific
methods , processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and 
unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application
domain.  Data science is related to data mining, machine learning, and big data."  So what does that mean to 
me?  It means that data science is using massive amounts of data to answer question such as: Does a $5 coupon
or a 25% off coupon result in more return customers, Is this an image of a cat or dog,  Which aircraft
is causing this radar signature, Is this pressure reading unusual, and What temperature will it be this weekend?

The Pay:
    Than why did I get into Data Science?  I had to think about this question for a good moment before being 
able to come up with an answer.  Well one of the main reasons that any adult looking for a new career thinks about
is the pay good? I can answer without a doubt and say the pay is pretty good.  A quick google search shows that
the average data scientist salary is $103,226 according to Indeed(https://www.indeed.com/career/data-scientist/salaries).
The second question is are their jobs available and how is there room for growth in the field.  
The outlook of the job is also very healthy.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics(https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm)
there is a growth of 22% between the period of 2020 to 2030.  Which means the field is growing and new jobs are being made
to accomadate for the demand.

The Interest:
    Do I enjoy making these graphs and charts that answer the questions that are asked?  I would say yes.  At my previous 
job as a Database Adminstrator/Developer I was assigned to make charts and graphs in a BI tool called Tableau with
data from the my previous companies database.  I absolutely loved doing this and being able to find changes and anomalies in the 
data by visualizing it in an easy to see format.  I was able to catch a few errors by being able to see the data visually
instead of looking through tens of thousands of rows.  This was one of the highlights of my day working there. I also was interested in 
the machine learning aspect of data science.  I took a course in university that gave a breif overview of what machine learning is.  A really
cool implementation of machine learning is AlphaGo.  AlphaGo used machine learning by taking in data from human and computer play in a board
game called go to learn to identify the best moves.  The ai program was than able to go and beat grandmasters in the game.  Through the subject
of data science I'll be able to learn more about the subject and feed my curiosity.

The Conclusion:
    The two items that mattered most to me about switching careers and learning about data science was the job viability and the interest
I had about the subject at hand.  I had learned through some research that not only did jobs related to the data science field end up being 
financialy rewarding, but the data science skill set is an in demand skill in the job market and there is growth in the data science field for 
the foreseeable future.  The second is the interest I had in the subject and I was already interested in manipulating data shown by my
previous job as a database administrator/developer.  I felt that it would be a natural progression in career choice going from a database Adminstrator
to a data scientist because of my interest in machine learning and data visualization.
